The .ll files in this directory have been generated with an older version of the
core library. Therefore these files won't link on a recent META-Backend version.

The files only serve an illustrative purpose.
They can easily be recreated on a macOS machine.

The 'old' core library used a different signature for the ComputeData::compute()
function. Everything else should be the same.
